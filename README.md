Web application for tasks organization created in [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), using API Routes, which let you create an API endpoint as a Node.js serverless function. I chose [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) as database, both for studying purposes, as for its easiness for cloud hosting using MongoDB Atlas.
