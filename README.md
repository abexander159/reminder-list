Web application for tasks organization created in [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), with API Routes and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). For studying purposes, I chose [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) as database, for its easiness for cloud hosting using MongoDB Atlas and [NextAuth.js](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) with [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0) integration for authentication.

In order to authenticate in the app with a better experience, please, use Google Account login method.
